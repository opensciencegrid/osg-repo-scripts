# This config file is written in Python ConfigParser style with ExtendedInterpolation:
# ${option} and ${section:option} are substituted at parse-time by ConfigParser
# $${EL} and $${ARCH} are substituted inside a loop at runtime

# The configuration here has an [options] section which defines global
# parameters that apply to all tags, and several [tag ...] and/or [tagset ...]
# sections that apply to a single tag (or tag set).

# Each [tag ...] section corresponds to a single Koji tag, whose "latest"
# directory under /mnt/koji/repos-dist on the Koji Hub will be rsynced.
# For convenience, you can make [tagset ...] sections that will be expanded
# into multiple [tag ...] sections, looping over the tagset's "dvers"
# attribute and substituting it into the "$${EL}" string.

# Values in the [DEFAULT] section are present in every other section (unless
# specifically overridden in that section).

source_rpms_subdir = src/Packages


# The condor-* sections contain external repo definitions for the HTCondor repos.
# The format is
#   <source subdirectory> -> <destination subdirectory>
# where the source subdirectory is relative to "condor_rsync" in the
# [options] section, and the destination subdirectory is relative to the
# "dest" dir for a tag.
#
# The attributes in these sections are not read directly by the distrepos
# program; instead, they are only used for substitution in other parts of
# the config.  "$${EL}" will be expanded to el8, el9, etc. based on the
# "dvers" attribute of a tag, and "${{ARCH}" will be expanded to x86_64,
# aarch64, etc. based on the "arches" attribute of a tag.
